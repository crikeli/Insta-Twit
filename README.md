# Reactive-Cocoa-Twitter-API
Working with API's and RAC

1) Navigate to project directory.

2) Run command "pod install" in your terminal.

3) Build and Run project from the  .xcworkspace file.

Further Comments: Through this exercise, I was able to visualize the way RACSignals work and their part in how executions of functions

on multiple threads works. I was also able to better understand how external API data can be parsed, manipulated and displayed in a tableview.
